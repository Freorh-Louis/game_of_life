An implementation of John Conway's game of life. Quick project I made for fun on my personal time.

This code simulte the game of life with python's import tkinter.
It allows the user to place cells left clicking and remove them by right clicking when the game is stopped.
The user can also chose the speed of execution.
Finally, the user can import .rle cell's structures and export his own structures as .rle files.
